# 🧩 Code Playground (General Purpose Online Code Interpreter)

**Code Playground** is a **web-based code execution environment** that allows users to **write, edit, and run code across multiple programming languages** directly in the browser.  
It leverages the **Piston API** for secure, sandboxed code execution and provides real-time output in a built-in console-like interface.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of **Code Playground** is to offer a **lightweight, browser-accessible environment** for testing and running code snippets in various programming languages — without requiring any local setup or installations.

Users can seamlessly switch between supported languages, edit code using a modern editor, and view the results instantly.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Multi-language support:**  
  Execute code in **JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and TypeScript**.

- **Monaco Editor integration:**  
  A feature-rich, IDE-like editor with syntax highlighting and smooth typing experience.

- **Version-specific execution:**  
  Each language uses its accurate version for consistent runtime behavior.

- **Live code execution (via Piston API):**  
  Code is sent to the Piston API for compilation/execution, and the output is rendered in real time.

- **Output panel on the right:**  
  Displays program results or errors clearly beside the editor for an efficient workflow.
